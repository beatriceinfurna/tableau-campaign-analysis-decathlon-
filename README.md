## Data & Methodology
- The Tableau analysis is based on a **pre-prepared relational dataset** provided for academic purposes.
- The data model includes fact and dimension tables such as:
  - Sales transactions  
  - Customers  
  - Products (SKU)  
  - Business units (stores, countries)  
- Data joins, calculated fields, and KPIs were created directly within Tableau.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The raw datasets are not included in this repository, as they were provided within a controlled academic environment.  
Selected outputs and visual material are shared for portfolio purposes only.
