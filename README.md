## Project Objectives
The dashboard and analysis aim to answer two main business questions:

   → Analysis of customer age distribution and demographics before and after the campaign.

2. **Was the campaign profitable for Decathlon?**  
   → Revenue and margin analysis using an assumed average margin rate of **20%**.

## Data & Methodology
- The Tableau workbook is based on a **pre-prepared relational dataset** provided for academic purposes.
- The data model includes fact and dimension tables such as:
  - Sales transactions
  - Customers
  - Products (SKU)
  - Business units (stores, countries)
- Data joins and calculations were performed directly within Tableau.

⚠️ **Note:**  
The raw datasets and Tableau workbook are not included in this repository, as they were provided through a private academic environment.
